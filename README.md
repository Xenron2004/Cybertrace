Step 5: Go to CanaryTokens and generate a new .xlsx file and copy this file to data folder.

# we are now done with setup, time to test our tool:
# step1: Open Honeypot at manual port, After that, Open ngrok in your Kali Linux.
# Step2: Copy fowarding port of ngrok to your new tab in tor browser and check IP address of TOR browser, to make sure there are two IP address in your system,One is your own and another one is TOR browser IP Address

# step3: when you open this forwarding link, username and password will be asked for login, just put 'admin for username' and 'password for password'. After that you will get to new directory page. and there will 
#         link of your data file generated by Canarytokens, when you open this file on your system, even in TOR browser, you Canary token will be trigerred and you get alert and Original IP address will be tracked.
